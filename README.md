# KoreanVideoPoker
A video poker game that reminds me 2005 when I used to play it on Bom Retiro, SP. A very lovely Korean neighborhood. 

The intent of this project is not only creating the game from scratch but also implement features such:
- a persistent Database to keep track of Player and Credits
- Login system

This will serve for practicing some key concepts on Java/Javascript/HTML.

This needs MySQL and Docker(for tests)
